I almost forgot, unpacking instructions for Adventure parts 1-7:

I packed the source using Mauldin's "packmail" program (much like
"shar"), compressed them on a VAX 8600 using compress 4.0 (max bits)
and then "uuencoded" the shar files. To unpack, remove the header, run
through "uudecode" producing the files "pack.out.0[1234567].Z",
uncompress them, put the "shar" files in whatever directory you want,
create the subdirectories "adv_db", "src/adv", "src/kio", and
"src/munge", feed the pack.out files to "unshar" or "sh" which will
recreate the source files, then "make" should do the rest. The result
"should be" an executeable file called "adv", and two large data files
(the key table and the database).  The program "munge" is used to
compile the database and isn't necessary except for this purpose.

The language compiled into the database is rather interesting but very
low level (i.e. basically like assembler).

My rationale for compressing the source was that it cut the size in half.
